# Copywriting Guide
> Curated content to become a copywriter.

Inspired by [P1xt guides for programming](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides), and after paying ~â‚¬800 for a copywriting course that was barely more than a series of blog posts, I asked for a refund and began my journey to compile the best free material to become a copywriter.
Note that, at this point, I'm doing this for myself, so I'll include material both in Spanish and English.
